//! The pseudo-terminal a pane of the talk window is filled with.
//!
//! What runs in a pane draws full-screen: an agent's interface is a TUI that owns the rectangle and
//! repaints it, so there is no stream of lines to split into a transcript and no place to put a
//! chat box beneath one. A pane is therefore a real terminal rather than a rendering of one
//! (`AMB-D-747`), and this module is the host half of it — opening a PTY, carrying its bytes both
//! ways, telling it how large the pane on screen is, and closing it.
//!
//! **Bytes travel whole, and nothing here reads them.** What comes off a PTY is a byte stream with
//! escape sequences in it, and a read ends wherever the kernel happened to fill the buffer — through
//! the middle of a sequence, or of a multi-byte character. Only the emulator drawing the pane can
//! put those back together, so a chunk is carried to the webview base64-encoded and handed over
//! exactly as it arrived. Decoding here would corrupt the split ones and buy nothing.
//!
//! **The session's name goes in as an environment variable**, and the whole of its value is that it
//! is inherited: an agent that runs `amenbo` from inside the terminal is several processes deep by
//! then, and what names its session has to survive that distance rather than be guessed at from the
//! outside.
