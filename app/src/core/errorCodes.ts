//
// On the producing side (Rust) the codes live in typed registries:
// - core's codes = `amenbo_core::ErrorCode` (`as_str()` / `ALL` in `crates/amenbo-core/src/error.rs`).
// - codes specific to the GUI surface = whatever the Tauri command layer raises via `CmdError::coded(...)`
//   (today, the guards in `project_add_folder`, which turns an existing folder into a new project —
//   `app/src-tauri/src/commands.rs`). CLI-only codes (`CliError`) never reach the webview, so they are excluded.
//
// This is the only TS definition of the codes a webview can receive. Copying code strings around by hand is
// forbidden; the Rust↔TS parity test in `errorCodes.test.ts` catches drift between the Rust source and this file.
// The generic fallback `"error"` — an ad-hoc error with no stable code — is not part of the contract and is excluded.
